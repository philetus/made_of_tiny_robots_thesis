\section{Responsive Environments, an Ontology and Ecological Analysis}
%

The age of ubiquitous computing \citep{weiser} is upon us. 
That is to say that as more and more of the devices that surround us feature embedded computation, sensing, and even actuation, our environments will become more responsive. 
And these devices will tie into networks through which they will feed data to powerful computational agents like the googlebot, which we will refer to generally as \emph{idols}.
As we enter into a cybernetic relationship with this new artifact ecology much of what we have until now considered our private personas will be determined by the behavior of the robotic devices we surround ourselves with and through them exposed to these powerful idols.
The character of this ecology, and what it means to be and individual within this new order, will depend largely on two factors: the transparency of these mechanisms to individuals, and their reconfigurability.

Below we outline an ontology of concepts [TODO]

> robunculi are a vision of a stable artifact ecology that is both transparent and reconfigurable. while this vision is extremely speculative, by establishing a language for discussing responsive environments as well as metrics for assessing the desirability for individual participants we can make a valuable contribution


> robunculi - convergence of responsive artifacts and kits of parts

> axes of ubiquity, transparency and reconfigurability

> [TODO: figures showing axes] (transparency - physically secured state/corp rental -> drm'd black box -> open source hardware) (reconfigurability - mass-manufactured widget -> custom-printed widget -> kit of parts -> hyperform)
