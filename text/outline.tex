  > a new era of computing
    - ubuquitous computing
    - cnc fabrication
    - hyperform specification
    - cyborgs
  > a new era of cognition
    - theory of mind
    - robunculi
    - paper vs calculators
    - neural vs embodied interfaces
      . mouse vs stylus
      . drafting vs drawing
  > a challenge for makers
    - embedded systems complex and span many apis at different levels
    - robunculi as global computational api
  > toward a global api for computational systems
    - vision
    - scope
      . what are the affordances of computational systems?
      . what should an interface to control these behaviors look like?
    - methodology
      . propose model of affordances
      . demonstrate descriptive capabilities of model through a survey of computational systems
      . develop api for these affordances through a series of case studies
    - goal: provisional api to aid development of robunculi
    
* model of the affordances of computational systems
  > technology (capability) vs affordance
  > input / description
    - pointing / selection
    - commands (keyboard, gestures, voice, joystick, instruments)
    - text (and speech)
    - form (2d / 3d / hyper)
      . blob vs blocks vs skeleton
      . placement
      . posture
      . constraint
    - algorithms (high-level ie state machine)
  > sensing
    - presence (what / who is around)
    - audio streams
    - photo / video streams
    - structural forces
    - environmental conditions (light, temp, etc)
  (> messaging?)
  > output / reification
    - display vs tasks
    - signalling (power led, net traffic led)
    - neural stimulation (ie vibe vest)
    - imaging / projecting
      . text layout
      . 2d graphics (canvas / brush / blitmap)
      . 3d rendering
    - speech / music / sound fx
    - posing
    - self-reconfiguring

* survey of the affordances of computational systems
  > paper / print
  > manipulatives (non-computational)
  > apps (document editor, hypertext browser, photo editor)
  > robots (with user interfaces ie roomba)
  > wearables
  > tangibles

* api case studies:
  > posey
  > prismatic cubes
  > human hive
  > espresso blocks / hyperforms
  > siftables
  > topobo
  > roblocks
  > ckbot

* conclusion
  > success of model of affordances
  > state of robunculi api
  > implications for development and toolchain

* appendix: a provisional robunculi api
