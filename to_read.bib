   abstract = {There have been many research efforts devoted to tangible user interfaces (TUIs), but it has proven difficult to create a definition or taxonomy that allows us to compare and contrast disparate research efforts, integrate TUIs with conventional interfaces, or suggest design principles for future efforts. To address this problem, we present a taxonomy, which uses metaphor and embodiment as its two axes. This 2D space treats tangibility as a spectrum rather than a binary quantity. The further from the origin, the more “tangible” a system is. We show that this spectrum-based taxonomy offers multiple advantages. It unifies previous categorizations and definitions, integrates the notion of “calm computing,” reveals a previously un-noticed trend in the field, and suggests design principles appropriate for different areas of the spectrum.},

While this work has been successful in mapping out a space of technical possibilities and providing a terminology to ground discussion, it provides little guidance on the cognitive or social effects of using one type of interface or another. In this paper we look at the area of learning with tangible interfaces, suggesting that more empirically grounded research is needed to guide development. We provide an analytic framework of six perspectives, which describes latent trends and assumptions that might be used to motivate and guide this work, and makes links with existing research in cognitive science and education. }

   abstract = {As we rapidly approach the day of transitive materials, made of individual elements that sense and actuate and can be programmed and reprogrammed, it is time to think about how to design things using these new materials. Our roBlocks construction kit toy teaching children about emergent behavior in complex systems serves as an example for investigating the challenges of designing things made of transitive materials. The roBlocks kit comprises heterogeneous modular robotics components that exhibit modularity, one-to-one mapping between form and behavior, and non-hierarchical control; and these features make it appropriate for experimenting with emergent behavior. However, as the numbers of robotic components scales to the orders of magnitude needed to consider them as material these same features also make it difficult to apply traditional methods to design constructions with desired behaviors. To understand this design space we built, the Erstwhile Agent that uses an evolutionary approach to automatically synthesize roBlocks constructions to meet specified desiderata.},

   abstract    = {Imagine a world in which our furniture moves around like
                 legged robots, interacts with us, and changes shape and
                 function during the day according to our needs. This is
                 the long term vision we have in the Roombots project. To
                 work towards this dream, we are developing modular
                 robotic modules that have rotational degrees of freedom
                 for locomotion as well as active connection mechanisms
                 for runtime reconfiguration. A piece of furniture, e.g. a
                 stool, will thus be composed of several modules that
                 activate their rotational joints together to implement
                 locomotor gaits, and will be able to change shape, e.g.
                 transforming into a chair, by sequences of attachments
                 and detachments of modules. In this article, we firstly
                 present the project and the hardware we are currently
                 developing. We explore how reconfiguration from a
                 configuration A to a configuration B can be controlled in
                 a distributed fashion. This is done using metamodules-two
                 Roombots modules connected serially-that use broadcast
                 signals and connections to a structured ground to
                 collectively build desired structures without the need of
                 a centralized planner. We then present how locomotion
                 controllers can be implemented in a distributed system of
                 coupled oscillators-one per degree of freedom-similarly
                 to the concept of central pattern generators (CPGs) found
                 in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals. The CPGs are
                 based on coupled phase oscillators to ensure synchronized
                 behavior and have different output filters to allow
                 switching between oscillations and rotations. A
                 stochastic optimization algorithm is used to explore
                 optimal CPG configurations for different simulated
                 Roombots structures. },

   abstract = {A persistent challenge in evolutionary robotics is the transfer of evolved morphologies from simulation to reality, especially when these morphologies comprise complex geometry with embedded active elements. In this chapter we describe an approach that automatically evolves target structures based on functional requirements and plans the error-free assembly of these structures from a large number of active components. Evolution is conducted by minimizing the strain energy in a structure due to prescribed loading conditions. Thereafter, assembly is planned by sampling the space of all possible paths to the target structure and following those that leave the most options open. Each sample begins with the final completed structure and removes one accessible component at a time until the existing substructure is recovered. Thus, at least one path to a complete target structure is guaranteed at every stage of assembly. Automating the entire process represents a step towards an interactive evolutionary design and fabrication paradigm, similar to that seen in nature.},

abstract = { ABSTRACT SUMMARYModular, self-reconfigurable robots are robotic systems that can change their own shape by autonomously rearranging the physical modules from which they are built. In this work, we are interested in how to distributedly execute a specified self-reconfiguration sequence. The sequence is specified using a simple and centralized scripting language, which either could be the outcome of a planner or be hand-coded. The distributed controller generated from this language allows for parallel self-reconfiguration steps and is highly robust to communication errors and loss of local state due to software failures. Furthermore, the self-reconfiguration sequence can automatically be reversed, if desired. We verify our approach and demonstrate its robustness in experiments using physical and the simulated ATRON modules, as well as simulated M-TRAN modules. Overall, the contribution of this work is the combination of the tractability of a centralized scripting language with the robustness and parallelism of distributed controllers in modular robots. }
